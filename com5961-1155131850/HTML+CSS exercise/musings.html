  <!--The CSS properties we use for that are 'padding-left' (to move the body text) and 'position', 'left' and 'top' (to move the menu).-->
  <!--The 'position: absolute' says that the ul element is positioned independently of any text that comes before or after it in the document and the 'left' and 'top' indicate what that position is.-->
  <!--In HTML, hyperlinks are created with <a> elements, so to specify the color, we need to add a style rule for “a”. To differentiate between visited and unvisited links, CSS provides two “pseudo-classes” (:link and :visited). They are called “pseudo-classes” to distinguish them from class attributes, that appear in the HTML directly, e.g., the class="navbar" in our example.-->

<h1>My second styled page</h1>

<p>Welcome to my second styled page!

<p>It lacks images, but at least it has style.
And it has links, even if they don't go
anywhere&hellip;

<p>There should be more here, but I don't know
what yet.
