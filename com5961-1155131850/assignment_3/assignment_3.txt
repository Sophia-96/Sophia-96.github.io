Assignment #3:
Scrap data from the web using ParseHub but provide me with the source (i.e. URL) of the original web pages.
Clean up the data with OpenRefine and send me the OpenRefine project file so I can open the project and trace your steps.
Import the cleaned data into Airtable.
Send me the link for viewing the result inside Airtable.
If you cannot find any data related to your topic that needs to be cleaned, just send me an OpenRefine project with problematic data that you¡¯ve fixed.
