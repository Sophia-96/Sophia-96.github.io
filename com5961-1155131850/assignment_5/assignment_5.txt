assignment #5:
1. Complete JQuery DataTable example using your own dataset from previous assignments. This requires you to convert your original file into JSON format.
2. Share the Airtable tables with both detailed data and rolled-up views embedded in a web page (or web pages depending on how you may want to show it) hosted on github that I can see without downloading the pages.
